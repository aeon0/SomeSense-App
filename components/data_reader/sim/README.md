# Simulation

OpenCept has a Carla integration for simulation. Add new scenes to this folder, they can be used in data_reader/cams/carla.cpp. Currently the scene generation is within the camera cpp file. In case mutiple sensors should exist in one scene this scene creation probably has to move to the sensor storage.</br>
Feel free to add new scenes and add a quick description below.

### example_scene.cpp
Just and example to show some basics of the carla client.
